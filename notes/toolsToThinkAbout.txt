Strategies:

    Looping/Recursing Backwards
    
    Dynamic Programming
        This is basically making a greedy problem out of something that
        is not greedy-able.
        Methods:
            - Do I know the target already? Can I do a bottom up approach?
            - Do I have info(or can I create info) that will allow a
            top down approach?
                * Can I get information about the top row and left column?
    
    Recursion
    
    Back Tracking (especially for game-board related things)
    
    Simulations by placing then removing and trying other incremented values.
    
    Binary Search to find numbers that cannot be algorithmically calculated in any other way.
