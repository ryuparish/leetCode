Tips:
    - Sometimes separating a piece of logic into a separate function can
    simplify the algorithm entirely.

    - Sometimes trying to be more leet can make the problem either very
    difficult or impossible. Always consider simpler methods if they
    are feasible.

    - Make sure you are very versatile with initialzation of variables
    and their correct values. This can be a brainfuck!
