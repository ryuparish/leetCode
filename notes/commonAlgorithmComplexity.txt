String Matching

    Rabin-Karp: 

        TC: O(nm - (n-1)) -> O(n*m) where n and m are sizes of the two strings. (n-1) is for sliding window not going all the way unless the window size is 1.
            This is due to the case of every letter match every time, e.g. searching for aaa in aaaaaaaaaaaa.

        SC: O(1), just use the arrays and two pointers.
