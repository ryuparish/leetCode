Here is a list of edge cases you should always watch out for (especially in Easy and Hard):
Arrays and Strings:
    1. Empty sequence.
    2. Sequence with only one letter or int.
    3. Sequence with only a space or a 0.
    4. Dealing with comparing two things of different sizes and/or one being empty.

Linked Lists:
    1. Empty Head node and only one node.
    2. Uneven or even number of nodes.
